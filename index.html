      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Even at a young age I have always shown a keen interest in coding, whether it was basic HTML/CSS or making videogames in 3D animation class. Sadly, My path veered away from coding and I earned a degree in Biology. After graduation I rediscovered coding and decided to enroll in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target= "_blank"> Thinkful</a>. I am beyond ecstatic to be working with others on future projects and growing my skill set along the way. Please feel free to <a href= "#contact-info">contact</a> me with any inquiries!</p>
